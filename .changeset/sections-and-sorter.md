Sections show in the rail and the slide sorter and can be added, renamed, removed, moved, and collapsed (`addSection`, `renameSection`, `removeSection`, `removeAllSections`, `moveSection`, `setSectionsCollapsed`, the `section.*` slots), and the new Slide Sorter view (`setPresentationView`, `PptxEditor.SlideSorter`, the `view.presentationView` slot) shows every slide by section. The `railContextMenu` popup entry covers the slide sorter, and the new `sectionContextMenu` entry (`SectionContextMenu`) replaces or turns off the section menu. A slide entry that repeats a slide id of another slide keeps its slide with a fresh id, so the slide list that the editor shows, the commands, and the saved file agree. In the Vue adapter, the `section.*` slots draw as buttons and `view.presentationView` works through `useEditorCommand`. The default editor's zoom pill moved into the status bar, next to the view switch.
