Published packages no longer ship source maps, so a stack trace points into `dist/`. Every JavaScript file of `pro`, `pptx-to-pdf`, and `editor-api` starts with its license header, and these packages are minified. The preset shape geometry in `core` carries the Ecma copyright notice in a legal comment, so bundlers that keep legal comments carry the notice into your app bundle.
